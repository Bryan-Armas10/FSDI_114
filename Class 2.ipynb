    "######## Definitions and Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "# a. Define what a stack is and provide at least two real-world examples where stacks are used.\n",
    "# Stack A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, meaning the last element added is the first one \n",
    "# to be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Real-world examples:\n",
    "# Stack of plates: When you stack plates, the last plate placed will be the first one to be taken off.\n",
    "# Undo in a text editor: When you use the undo option, the most recent action you performed is the first to be reversed, which implies a stack \n",
    "# structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "# b. Define what a queue is and provide at least two real-world examples where queues are used.\n",
    "# Queue A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, meaning the first element added is the first \n",
    "# one to be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Real-world examples:\n",
    "# Bank line: People are served in the order they arrived; the first to arrive is the first to be served.\n",
    "# Print queue: Print jobs are managed in the order they were sent to the printer.\n",
    "   \n",
    "######## Primary Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "# a. List and explain the primary operations performed on a stack.\n",
    "# push(): Adds an element to the top of the stack.\n",
    "# pop(): Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.\n",
    "# top(): Views the element at the top of the stack without removing it.\n",
    "# isEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# b. List and explain the primary operations performed on a queue.\n",
    "# enqueue(): Adds an element to the end of the queue.\n",
    "# dequeue(): Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue.\n",
    "# front(): Views the element at the front of the queue without removing it.\n",
    "# isEmpty(): Checks if the queue is empty.\n",
    "    \n",
    "######## Key Differences\n",
    "# Compare and contrast the behavior of stacks and queues in terms of their insertion and removal mechanisms. Use examples to illustrate your \n",
    "# vexplanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stack:\n",
    "# Insertion (push) and removal (pop) occur at the same end (top).\n",
    "# Operation order: LIFO (Last In, First Out).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Queue:\n",
    "# Insertion (enqueue) happens at the rear, and removal (dequeue) occurs at the front.\n",
    "# Operation order: FIFO (First In, First Out).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Stack: If we add elements A, B, C to the stack, the order of removal will be C, B, A.\n",
    "# Queue: If we add elements A, B, C to the queue, the order of removal will be A, B, C.\n",
    "\n",
    "######## Variations\n",
    "# Research and describe at least one variation of a stack (e.g., bounded stack) and one variation of a queue (e.g., circular queue). Explain \n",
    "# how they differ from the basic versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Limited Stack:\n",
    "# A limited stack is a stack with a maximum number of elements it can hold. If more elements are pushed than allowed, the stack raises an \n",
    "# error or returns a \"stack full\" signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "# b. Circular Queue:\n",
    "# A circular queue solves the problem of wasted space in a regular queue when elements are removed but space is still available. In a circular \n",
    "# queue, the end of the queue connects to the front, forming a circle, allowing more efficient use of space.\n",

    "######## Time Complexity\n",
    "# Discuss the time complexity of common operations (e.g., push, pop, enqueue, dequeue) for stacks and queues. Explain any differences you observe.\n",
    "# Stacks:\n",
    "# push(): O(1) – Insertion at the top.\n",

    "######## Real-World Applications\n",
    "# Compare how stacks and queues are used in computer science, specifically in areas like memory management, process scheduling, or data buffering.\n",
    "# Stacks:\n",
    "# Memory management: In operating systems, stacks are used for managing function calls and returns, especially in recursive function calls.\n",
    "# Undo in text editors: A stack is used to store previous states of a document and reverse actions in reverse order.\n",

    "# Queues:\n",
    "# Process scheduling: Processes waiting to be executed are managed using a queue (FIFO).\n",
    "# Data buffering: Queues are used for buffering data between different components, such as in network transmission.\n",

    "# Given the following scenarios, decide whether a stack or queue would be more appropriate and justify your answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "# a. Undo functionality in a text editor.\n",
    "#The undo operation (reversing the most recent action) is a typical stack operation (LIFO).\n",
